# Explanation

There are 3 files that contains implementation of the expected functions.

Header file and DayOfYear.cpp file contains implementation and declarations.
Main.cpp file contains tests.

For compiling all files. Just write `make`.

For see the result of valgrind that shows there is no memory leak.
`make memory` will be sufficient.

Also, de morgan rule output is too long. So I wrote result to a text file. At the end of the file, it can bee seen my implementation is correct due to de morgan rule too.

Finally, I added a general txt file that shows general output if you don't want to run the program. This output will shown.
